   abstract = {A neglected question regarding cognitive control is how control processes might detect situations calling for their involvement. The authors propose here that the demand for control may be evaluated in part by monitoring for conflicts in information processing. This hypothesis is supported by data concerning the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain area involved in cognitive control, which also appears to respond to the occurrence of conflict. The present article reports two computational modeling studies, serving to articulate the conflict monitoring hypothesis and examine its implications. The first study tests the sufficiency of the hypothesis to account for brain activation data, applying a measure of conflict to existing models of tasks shown to engage the anterior cingulate. The second study implements a feedback loop connecting conflict monitoring to cognitive control, using this to simulate a number of important behavioral phenomena.

   abstract = {The ability to detect an error in performance is critical to ongoing and future goal-directed behaviour. Diminished awareness of errors has been associated with a loss of insight and poor functional recovery in several clinical disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, addiction, schizophrenia). Despite the clear imperative to understand and remediate such deficits, error awareness and its instantiation in corrective behaviour remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the relationship between error awareness and future performance in order to determine whether conscious recognition of errors facilitates adaptive behaviour. Fifty-one healthy participants completed a motor Go/No-Go error awareness task that afforded the opportunity to learn from errors. A mixed-effects model was specified wherein awareness of an error was used to predict inhibitory performance on the following No-Go trial. The model revealed a significant predictive effect of error awareness on future performance, such that aware errors were more frequently followed by correct inhibitory performance. Notably, improvement in performance accuracy was not due to a temporary increase in conservatism of responding, but appeared to be a context-specific adaptation. These results highlight the adaptive role of error awareness and the relationship between error awareness and learning from errors that has the potential to contribute to clinical symptomatology.},

   abstract = {Post-error slowing is often considered to be an error-related process that relies upon conscious error recognition, however evidence regarding this relationship is mixed. These inconsistent findings may be explained by the influence of task demands on post-error slowing. The current set of experiments aimed to investigate the role of error awareness in post-error slowing in an error awareness task with up to three dynamic conditions. In each condition, we manipulated the interval between lure trials (infrequent trials that require a different response to target trials) such that they were presented either randomly (standard condition), closely spaced (proximal condition) or widely spaced (distal condition) among target trials. This design attempted to clarify if the relationship between error awareness and post-error slowing is contingent upon task constraints such as trial timing and whether it persists over several trials. Our experiments demonstrate that under dynamic lure interval conditions, error awareness and post-error slowing are only weakly related. Further, post-error slowing was greatest in the standard condition which randomly presented lure trials, while accuracy was lowest in this condition across both experiments. Exclusion of the first post-error trial from both experiments eliminated all effects, indicating that there were only transient differences in post-error reaction time adjustments that were exclusive to the first post-error trial. Our findings thus align with non-functional accounts of post-error slowing and support the notion that post-error slowing and cognitive control can be separate processes that are largely not dependent on error awareness.},

   abstract = {When our brain detects an error, this process changes how we react on ensuing trials. People show post-error adaptations, potentially to improve their performance in the near future. At least three types of behavioral post-error adjustments have been observed. These are post-error slowing (PES), post-error reduction of interference, and post-error improvement in accuracy (PIA). Apart from these behavioral changes, post-error adaptations have also been observed on a neuronal level with functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. Neuronal post-error adaptations comprise activity increase in task-relevant brain areas, activity decrease in distracter-encoding brain areas, activity modulations in the motor system, and mid-frontal theta power increases. Here, we review the current literature with respect to these post-error adjustments, discuss under which circumstances these adjustments can be observed, and whether the different types of adjustments are linked to each other. We also evaluate different approaches for explaining the functional role of PES. In addition, we report reanalyzed and follow-up data from a flanker task and a moving dots interference task showing (1) that PES and PIA are not necessarily correlated, (2) that PES depends on the response–stimulus interval, and (3) that PES is reliable on a within-subject level over periods as long as several months.},

   pages = {56-62},
   abstract = {People are usually faster before and slower after committing an error. This finding has traditionally been explained by strategic changes of response criteria to less or more conservative thresholds. This idea has been implemented in current cognitive control frameworks, where it is proposed that high or low levels of processing conflict can dynamically change these response thresholds to achieve optimal performance. However, recent evidence suggests that evaluation of conflict is time consuming and can potentially interfere with subsequent processing [Jentzsch, I., Dudschig, C., 2009. Why do we slow down after an error? Mechanisms underlying the effects of posterror slowing. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 62, 209-218]. The present study aims to extend this finding by investigating whether similar mechanisms underlie effects of pre-error speeding and posterror slowing and whether the amplitude of the Ne/ERN predicts posterror slowing in the current task setting. The response stimulus interval (RSI) was systematically manipulated. Speed-up in pre-error trials was unaffected by RSI, suggesting that this effect is not the result of strategic, time-consuming control processes. Posterror slowing dramatically increased and performance became more error prone with decreasing RSI, providing further evidence for the idea that error evaluation can produce substantial interference with subsequent trial processing, particularly when there is insufficient time between the error and the subsequent event. Importantly, we did not find a positive relationship between the RSI-dependent change in posterror slowing and the Ne/ERN amplitude, questioning a direct link between the amplitude of this component and the amount of subsequent performance adjustments.},

   abstract = {People generally slow down after they make an error, a phenomenon that is more pronounced for older individuals than it is for young individuals. Here, we examine the origin of this age-related difference in posterror slowing (PES) by applying the diffusion model to data from young and older participants performing a random dot motion task and a lexical decision task. Results show that the PES effects on response time and accuracy were qualitatively different for young and older participants. A diffusion model analysis revealed that following an error, older participants became more cautious, processed information less effectively, and spent more time on irrelevant processes. This pattern was evident in both the random dot motion task and the lexical decision task. For young participants, in contrast, the origin of the PES effect depended on the task that was performed: In the random dot motion task, the PES effect was due to time spent on irrelevant processes; in the lexical decision task, the PES effect was due to increased caution and decreased effectiveness in information processing. Overall, PES effects were much larger in the lexical decision task than in the random dot motion task. These findings indicate that PES originates from the interplay of different psychological processes whose contribution depends on both task settings and individual differences.

This phenomenon of post-error slowing (PES) is thought to reflect an increase in response caution, that is, a heightening of response thresholds in order to increase the probability of a correct response at the expense of response speed. In many empirical studies, PES is quantified as the difference in response time (RT) between post-error trials and post-correct trials. Here we demonstrate that this standard measurement method is prone to contamination by global fluctuations in performance over the course of an experiment. Diffusion model simulations show how global fluctuations in performance can cause either spurious detection of PES or masking of PES. Both confounds are highly undesirable and can be eliminated by a simple solution: quantify PES as the difference in RT between post-error trials and the associated pre-error trials. Experimental data are used as an empirical illustration.},

A new paradigm is presented where participants performed a flanker task followed by a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of numbers (1–9). In most trials, a letter was presented on three possible positions of the RSVP (1–3–6). This was done with and without immediate feedback on the flanker task. In both experiments participants had worse target detection after an error in the flanker task. These findings support non-functional accounts for error monitoring that predict decreased post-error performance (Dudschig and Jentzsch, 2009, Jentzsch and Dudschig, 2009, Notebaert et al., 2009). In a third experiment we tried to dissociate between a bottleneck and an orienting account and showed decreased target detection after irrelevant red signals, irrespective of frequency. This result is interpreted in support for the bottleneck account (Dudschig and Jentzsch, 2009, Jentzsch and Dudschig, 2009).},

The response–stimulus interval (RSI) was either short or long, using a between-subject (Experiment 1) and a within-subject design (Experiment 2). Posterror slowing was larger and posterror accuracy lower in short than in long RSI situations. Effects of stimulus contrast disappeared in posterror trials when RSI was short. At long RSIs, stimulus contrast was additive with posterror slowing.

The magnitudes of the increase in RT and the decrease in PE are different according as the error-trial stimulus is re-presented or the alternative stimulus is preservec. In addition, RT is quicker to recover its equilibrium value than is PE. This pattern of changes implicates two distinct adjustments to the underlying decision process following an error: (i) a selective outward adjustment of the boundary at which the error was uttered, and (ii) a delay, with respect to presentation of the reaction stimulus, of the epoch at which the subject begins sampling information from the stimulus display. When these ideas are concatenated with the sequential probability-ratio-test model for CRT, a theoretical relation can be derived between the difference in mean RT for an error and for the same response given correctly, on the one hand, and the decrease in PE on the trial following an error, given that the alternate stimulus is presented, on the other. This relation is satisfied by the data.},

   abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian modeling provides a flexible and interpretable way of extending simple models of cognitive processes. To introduce this special issue, we discuss four of the most important potential hierarchical Bayesian contributions. The first involves the development of more complete theories, including accounting for variation coming from sources like individual differences in cognition. The second involves the capability to account for observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models. For all of these potential contributions, we outline an appropriate general hierarchical Bayesian modeling structure. We also highlight current models that already use the hierarchical Bayesian approach, as well as identifying research areas that could benefit from its adoption.},

This latter hypothesis argues that infrequent events orient attention away from the task. Support for the orienting account was obtained in two experiments. Using a new experimental procedure, Experiment 1 demonstrated post-error slowing after infrequent errors and post-correct slowing after infrequent correct trials. In Experiment 2, slowing was observed following infrequent irrelevant tones replacing the feedback signals.},

Several methods have been proposed to quantify the post-error slowing effect, and we discuss two main methods: The traditional method of comparing response times in correct post-error trials to response times of correct trials that follow another correct trial, and a more recent proposal of comparing response times in correct post-error trials to the corresponding correct pre-error trials. Based on thorough re-analyses of two datasets, we argue that the latter method provides an inflated estimate by also capturing the (partially) independent effect of pre-error speeding. We propose two solutions for improving the assessment of human error processing, both of which highlight the importance of distinguishing between initial pre-error speeding and later post-error slowing.},

In both these investigations the occurrence of any error was signalled to subjects by the equipment on which they were tested. Either the display failed to change1 or the same signal was repeated after a brief interval2. In the latter case2 the times taken to respond and correct the error were even shorter than the response times when the same signal was repeated immediately after a correct response. Nevertheless, the fact the responses to error signals were faster than responses to any other signals from the display does not lead logically to the conclusion that they are not responses to external signals. We have investigated the time taken to correct errors when no indication was given by the equipment when errors were made, so that subjects were dependent for this information on their ability to monitor their own responses.},

   abstract = {It is well known that old people respond more slowly than young but it is not known whether these changes occur because some elements in control processes which are responsible for choice and execution of responses are impaired more than others by advancing age. In order to control response speed and accuracy human beings must be able to exercise control of three parameters: (1) they must detect errors when they occur; (2) they must be able to monitor and vary response speed so as to recognize, and avoid, faster RT bands at which errors are intolerably frequent; (3) they must be able to adaptively control response speeds so as to select optimal RT bands and avoid others which may be too fast or too slow. In two serial, self-paced C.RT experiments groups of old people were found to detect and correct their errors as efficiently as young. With increasing age RTs for error and for error correction responses remained relatively constant while RTs for correct responses and for other, arbitrary, error-signalling responses markedly increased. It seems that efficiency of error detection and maximal response speed are relatively unimpaired with age. It seems likely that slowing of C.RT with age is related to loss of precise control over speed at which responses can be made, or to loss of fine differentiation between ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ responses.},

All of the variables investigated affected the rate at which information was accumulated from the stimuli--called drift rate in the model. The different drift rates observed for the various classes of stimuli can all be explained by a 2-dimens;ional signal-detection representation of stimulus information.

   number = {2},
   pages = {123-167},
   abstract = {The paper discusses various arguments and lines of evidence with respect to discrete stage and continuous flow models of choice reaction processes and in particular to the applicability of the Additive Factor Method (AFM) which has always been strongly tied to discrete processing. The paper starts with a brief outline of Miller's three different aspects of ‘discrete’ and ‘continuous’ (internal code, transmission, transformation). It is argued that application of the AFM does not require discrete processing in all respects. Discrete internal codes are essential, discrete transmission is preferable but not absolutely necessary, while continuous transformation can be easily accommodated. Most research on the AFM shows consistent and robust evidence in favor of seven successive processing stages in traditional choice reactions. Some inconsistencies can be satisfactorily explained by effects of confounded variables; yet, there also remain some inconsistencies, in particular with respect to one-dimensional processing, which suggest limits of the AFM. A critical issue is speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT). Here, the decomposition technique proposed by Meyer et al. (1988a,b) offers a promising tool for studying discrete versus continuous processing. A second critical issue, basically at stake in selective attention paradigms, is what constitutes a signal. Finally, advocates of continuous flow often refer to psychophysiological research and in particular to evoked potentials (EP). It is argued that the relations between EP and behavioral research seem insufficiently clear-cut to allow conclusions on discrete stages versus continuous flow. In conclusion, discrete stage models should not be rejected too hastily. They tend to have stronger axioms and hence allow stronger predictions. Unless more explicit constraints are specified, continuous flow models have much less predictive power.},

   abstract = {Post-error slowing (PES) is consistently observed in decision-making tasks after negative feedback. Yet, findings are inconclusive as to whether PES supports performance accuracy. We addressed the role of PES by employing drift diffusion modeling which enabled us to investigate latent processes of reaction times and accuracy on a large-scale dataset (>5,800 participants) of a visual search experiment with emotional face stimuli. In our experiment, post-error trials were characterized by both adaptive and non-adaptive decision processes. An adaptive increase in participants’ response threshold was sustained over several trials post-error. Contrarily, an initial decrease in evidence accumulation rate, followed by an increase on the subsequent trials, indicates a momentary distraction of task-relevant attention and resulted in an initial accuracy drop. Higher values of decision threshold and evidence accumulation on the post-error trial were associated with higher accuracy on subsequent trials which further gives credence to these parameters’ role in post-error adaptation. Finally, the evidence accumulation rate post-error decreased when the error trial presented angry faces, a finding suggesting that the post-error decision can be influenced by the error context. In conclusion, we demonstrate that error-related response adaptations are multi-component processes that change dynamically over several trials post-error.},

   abstract = {Abstract Appropriately adjusting to errors is essential for adaptive behavior. Post-error slowing (PES) refers to the increased reaction times on trials following incorrect relative to correct responses. PES has been used as a metric of cognitive control in basic cognitive neuroscience research as well as clinical contexts. However, calculation of PES varies widely among studies and has not yet been standardized, despite recent calls to optimize its measurement. Here, using behavioral and electrophysiological data from a modified flanker task, we considered different methods of calculating PES, assessed their internal consistency, examined their convergent correlations with behavioral performance and error-related event-related brain potentials (ERPs), and evaluated their sensitivity to task demands (e.g., presence of trial-to-trial feedback). Results indicated that the so-called robust measure of PES, calculated using only error-surrounding trials, provided an estimate of PES that was three times larger in magnitude than the traditional calculation. This robust PES correlated with the amplitude of the error positivity (Pe), an index of attention allocation to errors, just as well as the traditional method. However, all PES estimates had very weak internal consistency. Implications for measurement are discussed.},

   abstract = {Posterror slowing (PES) refers to an increased response time following errors. While PES has traditionally been attributed to control adjustments, recent evidence suggested that PES reflects interference. The present study investigated the hypothesis that control and interference represent 2 components of PES that differ with respect to their time course and task-specificity. To this end, we investigated PES in a dual-task paradigm in which participants had to classify colors and tones that were separated by a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Errors in the color task caused PES both in the tone task of the same trial and the color task of the subsequent trial. However, while the former effect disappeared with an increasing SOA, the latter effect was independent of SOA and lasted for several trials. This suggests that errors simultaneously induce task-unspecific, transient PES reflecting interference and task-specific, more long-lasting PES reflecting control adjustments.

These findings support the idea that the occurrence or processing of unexpected error-like events interfere with subsequent information processing.

Additionally, the intertrial interval between both tasks was manipulated in order to investigate the duration of these negative after-effects. The results of the visual discrimination task indicated that the amplitude of the N1 component, which is related to endogenous attention, was significantly decreased following an error, irrespective of the intertrial interval. Additionally, P3 amplitude was attenuated after an erroneous trial, but only in the long-interval condition. These results indicate that low-level attentional processes are impaired after errors.},

   abstract = {Research in the field of mental chronometry and individual differences has revealed several robust regularities (Jensen, 2006). These include right-skewed response time (RT) distributions, the worst performance rule, correlations with general intelligence (g) that are more pronounced for RT standard deviations (RTSD) than they are for RT means (RTm), an almost perfect linear relation between individual differences in RTSD and RTm, linear Brinley plots, and stronger correlations between g and inspection time (IT) than between g and RTm. Here we show how all these regularities are manifestations of a single underlying relationship, when viewed through the lens of Ratcliff’s diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978, Ratcliff et al., 2008). The single underlying relationship is between individual differences in general intelligence and individual differences in “drift rate”, which is just the speed of information processing in Ratcliff’s model. We also test and confirm a strong prediction of the diffusion model, namely that the worst performance rule generalizes to phenomena outside of the field of intelligence. Our approach provides an integrative perspective on intelligence findings.},

   abstract = {There is considerable evidence showing that people slow down after making an error. The post-error slowing is typically interpreted as the result of adaptation processes raising response criteria in order to avoid future errors. Here we analyze performance results of a previous study examining the relation between intelligence and electrocortical concomitants of mental rotation. Participants performed a hybrid Choice/Go-NoGo task presenting stimuli upright or rotated (60, 120, or 180 degrees) in normal or mirror image. The results showed that low-ability participants responded slower overall and committed more errors—in particular on NoGo trials with 180 degrees rotated stimuli. We selected the error trials and 7 correct Go trials preceding the error trial and 3 correct Go trials following the error trial. The results showed considerable post-error slowing and revealed that this slowing was related to intelligence—low-ability participants showed greater slowing than high-ability participants. This finding was interpreted within the context of diffusion-modeling studies of post-error slowing and may suggest that the rate of evidence accumulation and, possibly, the setting of response thresholds on trials following an error is more vulnerable in low- relative to high-ability individuals.},
