# Talking about appendices
First-level headers create appendix-sections labelled A-Z. You can print tables here aswell and refer to them in your main part. They will receive a prefix to their Table/Figure Number based on the appendix section they are in (see Table \@ref(tab:appendix-example)).

```{r appendix-example}
apa_table(best_car, caption = "Best car only")
```

# Another section
this creates another appendix section
