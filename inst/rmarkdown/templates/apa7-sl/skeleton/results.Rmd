# Results
Write your results here. You can add chunks for additional analysis. But to ensure readability, I would recommend conducting all anaylsis inside the appropriately named children.

You can cite R-packages used by calling the object `r_citiations`. If you want to only cite R itself within your text, but refer to all packages used in a footnote, call `r_citations$r` in text and `r_citations$pkgs` after the end of the sentence. This report was generated using `r r_citations$r`. `r r_citations$pkgs`

You can print tables using the wonderful `apa_table` command provided to you by `papaja` (see Table \@ref(tab:results-example-table)). Here it is best to set the caption using the `caption` argument provided by `apa_table()`.

```{r results-example-table}
apa_table(best_cars_table, caption = "The top five cars by Miles Per Gallon (MPG)", note = "This table was generated using papaja::apa_table()")
```

As you can see, the best car is `r best_car$car`.
